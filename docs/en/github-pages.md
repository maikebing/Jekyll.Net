# Deployment

The repository now includes a `docs` directory shaped to work as a GitHub Pages style source site. It is also one of the project's golden regression fixtures, which makes it a useful reference for your own documentation repositories.

## Directory role

Inside `docs` you will find:

- `docs/_config.yml` for site-level settings, locales, navigation labels, and shared defaults
- `docs/_layouts` and `docs/_includes` for the shell
- `docs/assets` for the visual layer
- `docs/zh` and `docs/en` for mirrored bilingual content

## Custom domain settings

The site is now configured for:

```yml
url: https://jekyllnet.help
baseurl: ""
```

Because the site uses a custom domain, `baseurl` is intentionally empty. If the domain changes later, update both values together.

The repo now also carries `docs/CNAME` with `jekyllnet.help`.

## Basic GitHub Pages publishing shape

If you want GitHub to publish the source folder directly, use:

`Deploy from a branch` -> `main` -> `/docs`

That keeps the repository easy to inspect because the source and the published Pages site live side by side.

## When to use Actions instead

If you want a more explicit build pipeline, the repository now also includes GitHub Actions examples. That route is useful when you want to:

- build with a pinned .NET SDK in CI
- publish generated artifacts instead of raw source
- reuse a workflow for package or release automation

The related workflow guidance is summarized in [CLI and Development Workflow](/en/blog/cli-workflow/).
